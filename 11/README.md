This is a bit of a breather after so many high effort entries in a row. To be fair, I was
a little burned out from code guessing at this point. This round's entry uses a fake 
compression format that doesn't actually do much compression at all, but *technically* 
reduces the size of some strings. The format has a few fun tidbits inside, such as the presence
of a "copyright bit" used in some audio formats to detect the presence of copyrighted material.
