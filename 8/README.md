This entry, named "Shamelessly Mimicking and Subsequently Butchering the Technical Interview", is an homage to
the [classic series](https://aphyr.com/tags/interviews) by Aphyr. In each story, you witness an eccentric Norwegian
witch take a simple task found in a technical programming interview and solve it using an esoteric application of
a programming language and a hefty amount of mystic atmosphere, as the poor interviewer has to try and follow. 
Inspired and a little awestruck, I decided to make my own little derivation of it using Rust's type system as the 
catalyst for absurdity!
