# [Round 13](https://cg.esolangs.gay/13/): Compile brainfuck

[*Submitted entry*](https://cg.esolangs.gay/13/#11)

*Relevant files:* `codeguessing/src/main.rs`, `codeguessing/dotgit/*`

This round is a diversion. I submitted a zip file containing an innocuous Rust project,
but the `.git` directory is included, and contains files that theoretically incriminate LyricLy
as the author of the entry. 5 people guessed LyricLy for this entry, falling for the impersonation.

In the embedded `codeguessing/` folder, the `.git` folder has been renamed to `dotgit`, to avoid 
messing around with git too much
