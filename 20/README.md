*Relevant files:* `tic tac toesy woesy.hs`, `orig.bqn`, `this is what the code should look like.PNG`

The entry makes use of Haskell's unicode-aware custom operators and identifiers to, after a lot of preamble, creates syntax mirroring that of BQN's. The entry itself mimics its implementation in BQN, recreated `orig.bqn`. Because 
there may be font issues causing the entry preview to look ugly, check out `this is what the code should look like.PNG`.
