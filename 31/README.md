# [Round 31](https://cg.esolangs.gay/31/): Plan my week

*Relevant files:* `APYL.py`

The code implements pseudo-APL syntax within Python, using python's unicode-aware identifiers, operator overloads, 
and the fact that ** is a right-associative operator in the grammar.

There is a lot of preamble to set it all up, see in `cleartext.py`. The actual APL code is a bit unreadable in python,
so it's previewed in `orig.dyalog`.
