# [Round 9](https://cg.esolangs.gay/9/): Create a game

[*Submitted entry*](https://cg.esolangs.gay/9/#2)

*Relevant files:* `minesweeper2.js`

This entry is a command-line implementation of minesweeper "2". On top of a keyboard-only fully-terminal interface,
it introduces a couple interesting mechanics such as "Extra cording (sic)", which is an extension of chording in standard minesweeper.

In terms of code, I followed the following philosophy:

- Make the code as stupid as possible
- Use as much boilerplate as possible
- Make algorithms as inefficient as possible
- Use global variables as much as possible

In that vein, I of course also used JavaScript to implement this game!

This game is surprisingly addicting. I think the tight keybinds really help make the experience as authentic
to minesweeper as possible.
