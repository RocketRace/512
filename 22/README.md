# [Round 22](https://cg.esolangs.gay/22/): Draw a line

[*Submitted entry*](https://cg.esolangs.gay/22/#2)

*Relevant files:*: `Draw a line.wld`, `Line.plr`

This entry is not a soure file at all. It's a Terraria world and player data! Just load up the world with the player,
and the wiring will compute the task once triggered! Oh, and look out for easter eggs!

Fun fact! The wiring in the world does not actually implement "drawing a line". It implements flood fill, which was
the task of the previous round #21.

I liked making this entry. In particular, I liked coming up with little silly injokes and easter eggs to hide all over the place.
The inventory has lots of little references, check them out!
