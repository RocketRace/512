# [Round 42](https://cg.esolangs.gay/42/): Implement 2048

This entry uses my own rendering library `ti` to draw tiny pixel sprites to the screen
and to handle user input simply. I put in some effort to make sure the game runs smoothly
and has a satisfying feel. The instructions to playing are in the `instructions` file, 
but it's very simple. The code itself is standard, although I used some unconventional code
style in it.
