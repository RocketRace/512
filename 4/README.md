This round, I implemented a simple purely functional language as a simple string substitution
over python syntax. It implements function composition, partial application and a couple of 
"functional" operators! Surprisingly clean for something that's effectively regex compiled
into Python source code.

I made the function names as unhelpful as possible, poking fun at the names of certain Haskell
functions. I think they turned out quite nice. Overall, it was a fun challenge to write code
in this "new" language, especially
