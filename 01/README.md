This is the first round of the esolangs code guessing challenge. My entry is the start of a trend. It's the beginning of
my long tradition of writing confusing, broken, cursed, sometimes beautiful, often boundary-breaking snippets of code!

In terms of substance, this entry doesn't have that much. Most of the file is a red herring, full of non sequiturs and
meaningless noise. It won't be the first entry like this, but they will only improve in elaborateness.
