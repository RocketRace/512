# [Round 2](https://cg.esolangs.gay/2/): Solve a maze

The chaos has become more elaborate! This entry is another grab bag of misleading, strange, 
intentionally obscure and hard to read code. There's a lot of details and minute bits of complexity
in this one that's there for the attentive reader to giggle at, such as:

- The long chain of `__dunder__` methods on line 18 defines a function `s()` returning a numeric constant,
through a convoluted 1500-column process that involves a sequence of questionable variable names.
- The Entry() and Discriminator() classes implement a goto statement using ctypes.
- A lot of the code is misleadingly highlighted by syntax highlighters, confusing string literals with code 
and vice versa.
- And more smaller tidbits sprinkled throughout.
