Here's another game; this time, Tetris! I had a lot of fun working on this one!

A few facts!
- I learned to use WebGL specifically for this project!
- The game follows the leaked 2009 edition of the official Tetris guidelines, which define the behavior of
the game quite precisely! This includes rotations, kicks, timing, and more. I took
it upon myself to make a "faithful" tetris clone, and I am quite happy with the result!
- `<marquee>` tag my beloved
- It's fun to play!
