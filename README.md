# 512

This 2048 implementation was originally made for round 42 of the Esolangs Code 
Guessing competition. I pulled it into a separate repository, because it wasn't 
possible to clone the original on windows :) so I made this new repository.

This uses my own rendering library `ti` to draw tiny pixel sprites to the screen
and to handle user input simply. I'm very happy with it, it feels so smooth and nice to play.
