This 2048 implementation was originally made for round 42 of the Esolangs Code 
Guessing competition. I pulled it into a separate repository, because it wasn't 
possible to clone the original on windows :) so I made this new repository. I'm 
very happy with how smooth it feels. It uses my custom rendering library, [ti](
https://github.com/RocketRace/ti), too!

## Controls

* Move: arrows/WASD
* Retry: R
* Exit: ^C
* Tere is no undo feature, that would be cheating
* Redo: Y

Make sure to use a font with proper braille support. (Example in the RocketRace/ti repository)
