# [The Esolangs Code Guessing Competition](https://cg.esolangs.gay)

This repository contains all my entries to Code Guessing. I have added my commentary inside each entry's directory.
I think these entries are cheeky, imaginative, and cursed, but it's up to the reader to decide.

My favorites entries (in chronological order) are:
- #5 (The PYSP language)
- #6 (Utter horror using `#coding: unicode-escape`)
- #7 (A triple-polyglot file containing a hard-coded LL parse table)
- #8 (Shamelessly Mimicking and Subsequently Butchering the Technical Interview)
- #10 (A faithful Tetris implementation)
- #14 (Packing all my tricks into 40 columns of chaos)
- #17 (Using the field axioms to find prime numbers)
- #20 (Implementing BQN as a DSL on top of Haskell)
- #24 (Code art in shape of a tree)
- #32 (A maze generator written in Zirconium)
- #37 (Poorly computing digital roots using machine learning)
- #39 (More code art, this time in Haskell)
